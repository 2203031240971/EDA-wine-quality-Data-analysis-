🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Data Analysis
🔧 Tools & Technologies:
📁 Kaggle Dataset | 📓 Jupyter Notebook | 💻 VS Code | 🐍 Python
📊 Pandas | 📈 Matplotlib | 📉 Seaborn | 🧪 Scikit-learn | 🔢 NumPy


✅ Project Overview:
🔍 Developed a machine learning model to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties.
📁 Used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle containing red and white wine samples with quality scores.
📓 Implemented the project in Jupyter Notebook integrated in VS Code.


🔍 Data Analysis & Preprocessing:
🧹 Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, normalized features).
📊 Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
📈 Visualized feature distributions, correlations, and class imbalance.
⚖️ Balanced the dataset using stratified sampling and normalization techniques.


🤖 Model Building:
🚀 Built multiple classification models including:
✅ Logistic Regression
🌲 Random Forest Classifier
🧠 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
📐 Performed train-test split and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.


📌 Outcomes & Learnings:
🏆 Achieved XX% accuracy (replace XX with your actual result) on the test data.
📊 Gained hands-on experience in EDA, model selection, and performance evaluation.
🎯 Strengthened understanding of feature importance and data-driven decision making.
